  <p>STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Tairiq Matthews had a big heart, was a jokester, a talented boxer and was loved by many.</p>

  <p>He wasn't just "a kid on the street," his mother told the Advance.</p>

  <p>Matthews of West Brighton had only been 19 years old for two weeks when he was shot and killed while standing by a bodega near 487 Vanderbilt Ave. in Stapleton on June 30.</p> 

  <p>In the aftermath of his death, his mother was left questioning why her son was gone from the Earth so soon.</p>

  <p>"He had a future ahead of him. I never even had a chance to have a grandchild by him, he never even grew facial hair or hair on his chest. You know, he was still a baby, 19 years old," his mother Shawnell Matthews said.</p>

  <p>Matthews remembered how her son would always help his friends when they didn't have a place to stay. He would bring them to her home to stay and eat.</p>

  <p>"My son was a very, very loving caring person. He had a big heart," she said.</p>

  <p>Tairiq left behind his mother, stepfather, two brothers and a sister.</p>

  <p>Some of Matthews' fondest memories with her son includes the time when he brought home an Advance article written about Atlas Cops & Kids Boxing Club in which his photo appeared. Tairiq was a gifted boxer from a young age.</p> 

  <p>"When he was a baby, my aunt used to tell me 'he got a stamina, he got a physique like he's gonna be a boxer,'" Matthews said.</p>

  <p>Matthews' 10-year-old daughter remembers her older brother teaching her to box and singing to Bruno Mars together. Though she claims "he was horrible at singing," that was one of her favorite moments with him.</p>

  <p>Matthews said her son was a jokester and clumsy kid loved by many, whether family members, friends or mentors. Just a few days after his murder, an anti-violence rally was organized in his memory.</p>

  <p>"They all looked up to him. Everybody that knew Tairiq just really loved him," she said. "I used to be like 'oh well, damn, everybody love him, but won't y'all take him,' because you know he used to drive me crazy sometimes in the house. He was a clumsy kid, [he would] trip and fall and stuff. But he was loved by a lot of people."</p>

  <p>About a month or two before his death, Matthews had just graduated from the Arches program, a group-mentoring program that helps justice-involved young adults transform the attitudes and behaviors that led to their criminal activity which was part of his probation for a prior arrest.</p>

  <p>He was accused of weapon and drug possession in 2015. Matthews said the drug charges against her son were dropped and he pleaded guilty to the weapon charge for possessing a flare gun and entered the program.</p>

  <p>His mother said that was behind him, and Matthews was taking classes to get his GED and a security guard license.</p>

  <p>"He was struggling, he was trying to find himself and trying to do better for himself. He was about to start a summer job on the 5th I think before he died," Matthews' mother said. She added that he was trustworthy of people he shouldn't have been and hung around certain people he shouldn't have, but he was never a violent person.<p> 

  <p>"For him to get killed like that and people just act like it's nothing, 'another dead kid and that's it' because he hung around certain kids that had labels and names, it's just wrong. We all human beings, we all deserve to be respected as a human being."</p>

  <p>Matthews stressed that the violence and the glorification of violence in the streets needs to end. She said she wants people to realize that her son had a family that cared about and loved him because they knew the type of person he really was.</p>

  <p>"There were a lot of good things about [Tairiq] and I just want people to know that instead of looking at him as [if] he was a gang member, or he was a hood rat, or he was a kid from the ghetto or the streets. He was a really good person and a lot of people that were in different organizations and groups loved my son â€”- loved my son."<p>

  <p>On the day that Matthews was killed, his mother happened to be in the area where he was shot and witnessed her son laying on the ground. She said she couldn't see his face and didn't realize it was her son.</p>

  <p>She heard him call out to her three times.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I ended up in that area. I feel like God was trying to get me to save my son, but me not knowing that my son was there, I lost my chance," Matthews said. "That plays in my mind constantly, I can't hardly sleep, I have nightmares all the time."</p>

  <p>Police charged Davon Tramun, 18, of Mariners Harbor with second-degree murder in the slaying. At the time of his arrest the motive was unknown and a law enforcement source told the Advance there was no obvious dispute prior.</p>

  <p>Matthews said the death of Tairiq has broken her family and that she misses him everyday.</p> 

  <p>"I want the kid to know that murdering my son and the people that I believe were involved, that not only did they kill my son, but they killed me inside because it's like a piece of me was taken out and I can never place that back."</p>
